        Chris Brandin has coached basketball for many, many, many years.  His coaching style encourages constant improvement on fundamentals, and he is the original inspiration for the mission statement of the <b><span class="blue">Basketball Club</span></b>.  His three point range and post moves make him a deadly offensive threat on the court, and his position of authority in the Administration makes him a threat off the court.  The Cal enthusiast is known as an avid follower of the Dalai Lama.  Chris is an athletic assistant and a basketball coach.

      <p class="grid-text">
        Barry Treseler has lived for many, many, many, years.  As a result, he is able to pass on his wisdom and life lessons onto the <b><span class="blue">Basketball Club</span></b> through his upbeat attitude and loving nature.  For example, legend has it that he has outlawed the infamous ‘marshmallow pass’ due to its poor efficiency and low success rate.  As a coach to some, but a teacher to all, he is a role model for the entire community, as he comports himself in an extremely professional manner.  Barry is a history teacher and a basketball coach.

      <p class="grid-text">
        Gabriel Baker has always been the faculty advisor to the <b><span class="blue">Basketball Club</span></b>.  His history with the club dates back to 2016, where he played basketball with the current leaders of the club on Friday afternoons.  This weekly ritual carried into the 2017-18 academic school year, and his devotion to the sport of basketball and the basketball community is unparalleled in any other teacher.  During the creation of the club, it was a no-brainer that he was the perfect person for faculty advisor. Gabriel is a history teacher.
