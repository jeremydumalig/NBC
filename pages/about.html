      The <span class="blue">Basketball Club</span> is an internationally-recognized club, serving gifted players since August of 2017. Based in the neighborhood of Bay Meadows, the student-centered club is known for its distinctive innovative hands-on learning and its pioneering work in the education of teenage youth and adolescents. Its annual Basketball 101 series draws over tens and tens of players, coaches, and guest speakers from around the world, and the club also offers specialist coaching in numerous other core areas, including form shooting, daily dozen, power sevens, wing/post progression, and physical education.<br><br>The <span class="blue">Basketball Club</span> began as the dream of Jeremy Dumalig and grew from his conviction that each player has a responsibility to make the world a better place. The friend of two fellow basketball players, Jack Brasesco and David Shields, Jeremy decided in late 2017 to make a significant contribution to basketball. His initial investigations convinced him that little attention was given to gifted players, so he met with noted coaches, players, spectators, parents, and specialists in basketball to investigate the needs of gifted players and the resources within schools. Jeremy’s investigations resulted in the establishment of the <span class="blue">Basketball Club</span> in 2017. The club has a staff of three administrators: Jeremy Dumalig, the president and head of communications, Jack Brasesco, the spokesman, and David Shields, the marketing director.<br><br>The <span class="blue">Basketball Club</span> uses a dynamic educational model to enable gifted players to learn how to make choices that will benefit the world, inspiring passion for lifelong improvement, fostering social and emotional acuity, and developing the student’s basketball skill.
